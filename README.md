Objective: Reduce energy consumption in multi-robot warehouse environments.

Existing Approach (RLS):
---------------------------
Models energy as a quadratic function of load and distance.

Enables load transfer from overloaded to underloaded robots.

Selects optimal meeting points and transfer amounts.

Demonstrates efficiency gains compared to no load sharing.


Proposed Extension (AI-based):
--------------------------------
Integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for real-time, adaptive load sharing.

Considers dynamic factors like battery levels, task reassignment, and robot failures.

Learns optimal load transfer strategies instead of relying on static heuristics.

Improves scalability and adaptability across different warehouse layouts.
